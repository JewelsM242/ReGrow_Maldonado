Project Name: ReGrow

Description: A Four Person Project focused on creating a game in which the player
tends to various events that occur on a space themed biosphere.

Timeline: Project was completed for a game making competition and completed within 2 months.

My Contribution: I participated as the main programmer to the project and implemented much of the mechanics into the game.
Some mecanichs I've made, but are not limited to:
- A collection of "interactables" that contain overridden methods and variables, but all derive from one abstract class
- A system of goals that check for objectives the player has completed and changes the game based on the objectives.
- A parser that allow for my teamates to easily implement game triggers and dialouge without needing coding expierence.
- Player controls that allow for movement, interaction, game slow down, and position rewinding.

This is the full repository of the game; 
however, if you'd like to only see the game itself, the final build is also in this folder under "ReGrow_Final".
