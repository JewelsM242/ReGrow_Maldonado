#This is the Goal Document. This helps make the trigger stuff actually readable
#Below are two examples of goals and what happens
#The first is a goal that requires Fire1 turned off, the first interactable (0) of Pair1 to be turned off, and
#Button1 to be activated at least once (these can be in any order)
#After that occurs the two dialogues will appear one after another

{Goal}
{Objective}
Fire1 | off
Pair1 - 0 | off
Button1 | start
{Trigger}
Dialogue | Wow you got the fires!
Dialogue | Good job
{End Goal}

# This is another example that uses "Activate"
# Like before the goal requires that Button1 be used
# After this Fire1 will be turned on and a dialogue will appear saying that a fire has started
# This is followed up by Don't Panic.
# You can any number of goals at that start with a potential to add more in the future (if I get to it)

{Goal}
{Objective}
Button1 | start
{Trigger}
Activate | Fire1 , true
Dialogue | Oh no! You started a fire!
Dialogue | Don't Panic!
{End Goal}
